# DAGMRNet: Attentive Graph Learning with Dynamic Neighbor Selection for MR Image Reconstruction 

This repository contains the pytorch implementation of DAGMRNet, a comprehensive model to reconstruct multi coil cardiac MRI in k-space from CMRxRecon dataset. In this model we have advanced a graph neural network well-equipped with dynamic attention mechanism which selects neighbors with a dynamic manner according to a KNN module to update the target node relatively. The proposed model is implemented with inspiration from promptMR and DAGL model.
