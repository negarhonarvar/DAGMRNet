# DAGMRNet: Dynamic Attentive Graph Learning Cardiac MR Image Reconstruction 

This repository contains the pytorch implementation of DAGMRNet, a comprehensive model to reconstruct multi coil cardiac MRI in k-space from CMRxRecon 2024 dataset. 

## Method

This model utilizes a " Dynamic Attentive Graph Learning " model as a denoising network for reconstructing cardiac MRI based on " Self Similarity " Image prior. The Architecture of our proposed model is shown below:
